# A4 penguin-walking

Assignment No 4 for the computer graphics course. Using three.js, make a penguin walk using keyframes. Use the included OBJ file to load the penguin into a scene. The penguin must also be correctly facing the direction it is walking towards. Consider that penguins walk with a wobbling gait: they walk unsteadily balancing from side to side with every step they take.

The penguin has to move in an *8* pattern while walking.

- Create a scene with lighting, and shadows. Add an orbit controller to control de scene.
- The canvas must cover the whole window.
- Load the OBJ file into the scene.
- The penguin must start and end at the center of the 8 pattern.
- Define the keyframes needed for the penguin to walk in an 8 pattern.
- Define the keyframes needed for the penguin to balance from side to side while walking.
- Define the keyframes needed for the penguin to face in the correct direction.
- The animation must last at least 10 seconds.
