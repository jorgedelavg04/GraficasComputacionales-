# Final Project, First Submission

Define your team, and 3 possible ideas for your computer graphics final project using Threejs. The team must be formed by 2 members. If the project's scope is larger, a third member could be considered. The project has to have 3D models, animations, shaders, interactions with the user, a user interface, and sounds. 

For each idea, define the following:

- The objective/idea of the project
- How the user will interact with the project
- What controls/shaders/additional libraries you are going to use or need
- References to similar projects
